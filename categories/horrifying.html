            <h1>Horrifying dreams</h1>

            <h3>Past trauma</h3> 
            <p>Dreams that feel extremely horrifying may be trying to tell you that you have some unresolved issues from the past. This might be a trauma and might actually not at all have to do with your experience but has a slight agreement. </p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3>Shame or guilt</h3>
            <p>Having horrifying dreams may also mean that you are in an emotional intense rollercoaster with yourself. Feeling extremely ashamed or guilty may cause your mind to think negatively about everything. Even your dreams will suffer from that. If you have a lot of horrifying dreams you may want to do some research and see where you get it from. It might actually be quite serious. </p>
