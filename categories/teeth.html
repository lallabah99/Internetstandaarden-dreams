                <h3>Falling out</h3> 
                <p>Dreaming about your teeth falling out is a very common dream. It might mean you are not ready for something that is just thrown at you and you're unable to control. These dreams result out of anxiety or fear.  </p>

                <h3>Rotten teeth</h3>
                <p>It can also happen that you dream about you're teeth being rotten. This means, like dreams about being naked, that you are embarresed about something. And you feel exposed to people. In most cases, dreams about rotten teeth, mean you might be insecure and looking up to others.</p>
