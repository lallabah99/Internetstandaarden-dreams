             <h3>Fear</h3> 
             <p>Cheating is a very frequent subject in dreams. It can be about you cheating or your beloved partner. In both cases it can mean that you are doubting the loyalty in your relation ship. If these dreams are getting annoying you might want to talk this issue out. Tell your partner why you doubt their loyalty.</p>

             <h3>Past experience and guilt</h3>
             <p>Cheating in a dream can also mean that you feel guilty about being dishonest to your partner. It can be something that happened in a previous relationship or now. It does not have to mean that you have cheated, but can also mean you feel guilty about a lie you told your significant other years ago. It tells you to let go of the guilt.</p>
