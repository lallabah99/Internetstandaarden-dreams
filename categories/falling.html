            <h1>Dreams about falling</h1>

            <h3>In your bed</h3> 
            <p>Sometimes when we try to fall asleep, we may experience a weird feeling of falling while actually still lying in bed. This wakes people us most of the time. Like you scare yourself awake. This means that you have something on your mind that you cant let go. Falling in your bed is your mind reminding you that you should worry about something. Just ignore this and sleep further. </p>

            <h3>Outside</h3>
            <p>You can also experience falling down outside. From a mountain for example. This may signify you feel like you don't have things under your control. Think about the thins you want to control, but are not able to right away. And then think about what you would need to resolve the issues.
