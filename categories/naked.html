            <h3>Shame</h3> 
            <p>Being naked in a dream means you are not protected by clothes. It litteraly means you feel exposed. Is there something you're ashamed about? This can actually be anything, so even a thing you didn't even realise you were ashamed about. Or something that happened when you were still a kid. </p>

            <h3>Forgetting something</h3>
            <p>Being naked may also initiate you forgot something. Your dream may be about you realising you forgot to put on some clothes. This might be your subconsious trying to tell you that you forgot something in real life. Think about it! </p>
