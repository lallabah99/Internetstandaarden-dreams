            <h3>Creativity</h3> 
            <p>Whenever we dream, weird things can occur without even noticing. Certainly a flying tiger can pass by and it will all seem normal. This might mean that you are a very creative person. Your mind will make up these unexisting creatures, because of your creative and endless thougths.</p>

            <h3>Chaotic</h3>
            <p>You might also be a bit chaotic when your dreams are absurd and unrealistic. This is because all your thoughts will merge together into a creative mess. It tells you that you are creative but should do a little cleaning up in de mind. Maybe meditating will make you feel better.</p>
